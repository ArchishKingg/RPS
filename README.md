# Rock Paper Scissors
> Same Rock Paper Scissors Game with **Computer AI** in **GUI** form.

## About the Game
Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as roshambo or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

You will have a GUI window divided in two sections vertically. One side for the Computer which will throw Rock Paper and Scissors Randomly. And one side is for the user who will play the game. The User will be given three options to throw, i.e, Rock, Paper, Scissors. At first there will be a welcome screen which will have a typical game loading screen.
U can see high scores. U will be asked for how many rounds you want to play. 

> We will try to make the game in GUI using Python
